# Box_plot
![Box_plot](https://github.com/Sans9211/Health_Insurance_Claim/assets/104644783/7c9a9b0a-6b07-4bab-863b-c9aad1c26360).

- Purpose: Visual summary of dataset distribution.
- Components: Box, line (median), whiskers, outliers.
- Box: Middle 50% of data, represents interquartile range (IQR).
- Line: Median (middle value).
- Whiskers: Extend to min and max within a range (commonly 1.5x IQR).
- Outliers: Data points beyond whisker range, shown separately.
  
# Count_plot

- Purpose: Visualize count or frequency of categorical data.
- Data Type: Used for categorical or discrete data.
- Representation: Bars show count of each category.
- Axes: X-axis for categories, Y-axis for counts.
- Use Cases: Analyzing age groups, word frequency, product categories.
- Variations: Bar plots, bar charts.
- Tools: Created with Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) or R.
- Interpretation: Quickly compare category frequencies.

  # Heatmap

- Purpose: Visual representation of data using colors to represent values in a matrix or table.
- Data Type: Often used for displaying correlations, distributions, or relationships in tabular data.
- Representation: Grid of colored squares, where color intensity represents data values.
- Colors: Typically a gradient from a low value (e.g., cool colors like blue) to a high value (e.g., warm colors like red).
- Use Cases: Analyzing correlations in data, showing concentration or density in a matrix, visualizing relationships.
- Tools: Created using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib (Python) or ggplot2 (R).
- Interpretation: Helps identify patterns, trends, and relationships within data at a glance.

  # Pairplot

- Purpose: Visualize pairwise relationships and distributions between multiple variables in a dataset.
- Data Type: Typically used for exploring numerical variables.
- Representation: Grid of scatterplots for each pair of variables and histograms for individual variables.
- Use Cases: Identifying correlations, distributions, and potential patterns in multivariate data.
- Tools: Created using data visualization libraries like Seaborn (Python).
- Interpretation: Provides a quick overview of how variables relate to each other and their individual distributions in one visualization.

  # Histogram

- Purpose: Visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable.
- Data Type: Typically used for numerical data.
- Representation: A bar chart that displays the frequency or count of data points within predefined bins or intervals.
- X-Axis: Represents the variable's values divided into intervals or bins.
- Y-Axis: Shows the frequency or count of data points in each bin.
- Use Cases: Analyzing data distribution, identifying patterns, and understanding data spread.
- Tools: Easily created using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib (Python) or ggplot2 (R).
- Interpretation**: Helps visualize the shape, center, and spread of the data, as well as potential outliers.
